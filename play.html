        <h6>A DOLLAR BY DAVID PINSKI</h6>

        <P>COMEDIAN. [_Stepping toward the sign-post, reading the directions on the
            boards, and explaining to the approaching fellow-actors._] That way
            [_pointing to right and swinging the valise to indicate the direction_]
            is thirty miles. This way [_pointing to left_] is forty-five--and that
            way it is thirty-six. Now choose for yourself the town that you'll never
            reach to-day. The nearest way for us is back to where we came from,
            whence we were escorted with the most splendid catcalls that ever
            crowned our histrionic successes.
            
            VILLAIN. [_Exhausted._] Who will lend me a hand to wipe off my
            perspiration? It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth.
            
            COMEDIAN. Stand on your head, then, and let your perspiration water a
            more fruitful soil.
            
            VILLAIN. Oh!
            
                 [_He drops his arms, the bundles fall down. He then sinks down onto
                 one of them and wipes off the perspiration, moving his hand wearily
                 over his face. The_ TRAGEDIAN _and the_ "OLD MAN" _approach the
                 post and read the signs_.
            
            TRAGEDIAN. [_In a deep, dramatic voice._] It's hopeless! It's hopeless!
            [_He lets go his end of the trunk._
            
            "OLD MAN." [_Lets go his end of the trunk._] Mm. Another stop.
            
                 [TRAGEDIAN _sits himself down on the trunk in a tragico-heroic
                 pose, knees wide apart, right elbow on right knee, left hand on
                 left leg, head slightly bent toward the right_. COMEDIAN _puts down
                 the valises and rolls a cigarette_. The "OLD MAN" _also sits down
                 upon the trunk, head sunk upon his breast_.
            
            VILLAIN. Thirty miles to the nearest town! Thirty miles!
            
            COMEDIAN. It's an outrage how far people move their towns away from us.
            
            VILLAIN. We won't strike a town until the day after to-morrow.
            
            COMEDIAN. Hurrah! That's luck for you! There's yet a day-after-to-morrow for us.</P>
