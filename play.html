        <h5>A DOLLAR BY DAVID PINSKI</h5>

            <p class="direction">[_Stepping toward the sign-post, reading the directions on the
            boards, and explaining to the approaching fellow-actors._]</p>
            <p class="speech">That way</p>
            <p class="direction">[_pointing to right and swinging the valise to indicate the direction_]
            is thirty miles. This way [_pointing to left_]</p>
            <p class=speech>is forty-five--and that
            way it is thirty-six. Now choose for yourself the town that you'll never
            reach to-day. The nearest way for us is back to where we came from,
            whence we were escorted with the most splendid catcalls that ever
            crowned our histrionic successes.</p>

            perspiration? It has a nasty way of streaming into my mouth.
